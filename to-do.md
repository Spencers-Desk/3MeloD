create kinematics for core X-Y

create kinematics for core X-Z

Output maximum velocity required to play highest note in song for each axis

Create separate config file that script reads in (no copy pasting printer configuration into script)

improve rhythm (if whole note requires too long of a move, split it in half instead of 1/4 & 3/4 etc.)

Create web server to host the script so downloading python, IDE, files etc. isn't required

Create "Music" directory for all songs

Add tempo switching (should be easy)

MIDI file read ins?
